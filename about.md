Tech person who is always looking for the best technological strategies, software architectures and base projects to implement in the product roadmap to resolve client’s challenges. 

Serial entrepreneur, co-founder of Beetripper, Taptaptravel, Portium and Footters. I like to know projects and people to give them my opinion on what technology to use and define a strategy based on a road map. Coffee lover, so you have it easy if you want to meet with me.
