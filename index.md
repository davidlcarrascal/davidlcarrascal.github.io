# Hola 👋

As a Software Engineer with experience in the industry, I have a passion for building innovative and scalable solutions that deliver value to users. My expertise includes full-stack development, with a focus on building B2C platforms and large-scale data processing systems.

I have a track record of success in leading software development teams, having served as CTO of Footters and currently serving as Head of Software Development at Sevilla FC. Here, I have gained experience in working with Big Data and AI, further strengthening my technical skillset.

I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a software engineer.
